    <h2>First Blog</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The first week of semester two , me and my group partner got all the project parts together that we had ordered. We began by installing arduino ide on our laptops , to get a basic understanding of how the programming language works. We noticed our first minor problem that the usb cable we were using was just simply charging the arduino board.</p>
    <p>Any program we tried to test would not work , so we ordered a new usb cable that would be specifically for transferring data.</p>

    <h2>Second Blog</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
    The second week of semester two, we decided to create a github.io website to post blogs , any information and progress of our third year project</p>

    <p>The new micro usb cable arrived that we had ordered , allowing us to properly test programs on the arduino board. We started designing a protype and learning the functionallity of the microphone and accelerometer</p>

    <p>We also were learning about the Arduino IDE programming langauge that we had installed on our pcs.We noticed the IDE gave various example code to help learn the fundamentals and test run them on the arduino board</p>

    <h2>Third Blog</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
    The third week of semester two, we started working on the LED Matrix.</p>
    
    <p> We connected the LED Matrix onto the Arduino board using female to male wires and crocodiles clips into the Appropriate pins with the aid of the datasheet provided for the MAX7219 LED Driver. </p>
    
    <p>The VBATT pin from the Arduino is connected to the VCC of the LED which is used to power the LED, The GND is connected to the GND, The DIN is connected to the #6 Pin in the Arduino board which is responsible 
    for the interpreting the code that is inputted, The CS is conntected to the #12 Pin which is responsible for the input delay. The CLK Pin is connected to the #10 Pin.</p>
          
    <p>We completed our prototype , which was one of the most basic programs we could produce. The prototype basically printed "Hello World" on the LED matrix , which can be seen in the video below. </p>
    
    <video width="320" height="240" controls><source src= "prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

    <p>Near the end of week three we created a program to turn on certain led lights on the adafruit playground classic depending on sound volume.</p>

    <p>Achieving this , helped us figure out how to use the microphone on the playground circuit and display the LED lights on the LED matrix depedning on volume.</p>

    <p>By the end of week three , our project was capable of playing animations on a 8x8 matrix with sound.</p>

    <h2>Fourth Blog</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
    The fourth week of semester two, our objective was to play animations on 8x32 matrix.</p>

    <p>Which we completed at the beginning of the week , even though our project was able to display animations with sound. We were unhappy as the mouth animation would not stay open for how long the user was speaking.</p>

    <p>We modified the code by converting the microphones audio input from "baud" to "decibel".As we were more educated on the decibel unit of measurement than baud , this allowed us to make the mouth animation more realistic.Now the mouth animation would stay open depending on how long the user would be speaking for.</p>

    <p>The issues we still face is the accelerometer loop seems to be infinite,user may need to take quite long pauses when speaing into the microphone for a realistic mouth movement and finally working on differnt set of word patterns to mimic a mouth.</p>

    <h2>Fifth Blog</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
    We began week five by creating a Testing document "testing.md" on our gitlab repository, this was created in the Testing directory. This document will describe each testing case that takes place for the duration of our project. (please see link below)</p>

    <p><a href="https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/ocionnm3/2021-ca326-mkenny-clothing-basedwearabletechnology/blob/master/Testing/testing.md">Testing Document</a></p>

    <p>Jude added images of the serial plotter to the Testing directory. These were images of common phrases used for pattern matching for example "hello" , "how are you" , "what's up" etc.. Which can be seen here:
    </p>

    <p><a href="https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/ocionnm3/2021-ca326-mkenny-clothing-basedwearabletechnology/tree/master/Testing/voice_graph">Voice graph directory</a> </p>


    <p>I (Matthew), added two new subdirectories to the Testing directory. The first being "Testing sounds" which will store audio and video files displaying various sounds that we used to test. I added a video displaying a continuous sound and once the continuous sound played for at least 5 seconds a certain text will be printed on the serial monitor. </p>

    <p>We also began adding all relevant programs to the code directory, this would be all programs we have used throughout the project. This will show the life cycle of our code development for our final product</p>

    <p><a href="https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/ocionnm3/2021-ca326-mkenny-clothing-basedwearabletechnology/tree/master/code">Code Directory</a> </p>

    <p>I worked on creating a simpler system to understand the reading of the accelerometer. Similar to what I done for the microphone converting from baud to decibel, I created a method which will calibrate the X, Y and Z sensors for more understandable reading. I added some video files to the "Testing_accelerometer" directory displaying the testing. Which can be seen below</p>

    <p><a href="https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/ocionnm3/2021-ca326-mkenny-clothing-basedwearabletechnology/tree/master/Testing/Testing_accelerometer">Calibrate accelerometer (testing videos) </a></p>


    <p>In conclusion at the end of week five semester two, we were satisfied that we could display various animations depending on volume and time length of volume input. Which is currently helping us create a more advanced pattern matching system for various volume inputs. We will be uploading more testing, code, sound and video files on to our gitlab soon. Our main issue is still with the accelerometer and led matrix being ran at the same time. Possibly the CircuitPlayground.begin and led control libraries are conflicting as they both define the data pin or spi. When we execute the Led matrix and accelerometer, the Led matrix would flash rapidly and not display our desired animation. </p>

    <h2>Sixth Blog</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      In the sixth week we tried figuring out a way to pattern match by using a counter that measures how long the user will speak and another counter for counting the decibels. The thought process of this was that when a user speaks "Hello" and while checking the serial monitor the dB value ranges from 60 - 63 and appears 3 times in the serial which is the duration of how long it took to say the sentence. Conditions would be then placed to check for these values and display the corresponding animation</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Matthew added Test 6 into the testing directory which explains the process of using the accelerometer mentioned in last weeks blog</p>

    <p><a href="https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/ocionnm3/2021-ca326-mkenny-clothing-basedwearabletechnology/commit/e254eb831fc555784c4b506d3ab4a9bc90637e6b">Test 6</a></p>

    <p class = "paragraph">We have been testing each of the components individually up to now and are working properly. A problem arised when you try to make all the components work together at the same time, the accelerometer inhibits the MAX7219 LED from lightning when initializing the library for the CircuitPlayground. We asked our supervisor what might be the problem and advided us that it might be problems within the SPI bus. This was the problem as when checking the libraries (CircuitPlayground.h and LEDcontrol.h) the SPI connections were conflicting. Numerous hours was spent trying to figure out how to create new connections for the SPI but failed and decided to buy a different LED Matrix which had less Pins needed to run it. The WS218 LED panel was the solution for this as it only needed 3 Pins DIN, 5V and GND. A new library was used and a different way of mapping animations into the LED panel. The new panel was also smaller and more appropriate to be put in a mask and allowed for colors to change which the other did not. </p>
