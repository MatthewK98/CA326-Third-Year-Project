    <h2>This is my First Blog</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
  The first week of semester 2 , me and my group partner got all the project parts together that we had ordered. We began by installing arduino ide on our laptops , to get a basic understanding of how the programming language works. 
  <p>We noticed our first minor problem that the usb cable we were using was just simply charging the arduino board.</p>
  <p>Any program we tried to test would not work , so we ordered a new usb cable that would be specifically for transferring data.</p>
