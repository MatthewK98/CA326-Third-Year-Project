    <h2>First Blog</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The first week of semester two , me and my group partner got all the project parts together that we had ordered. We began by installing arduino ide on our laptops , to get a basic understanding of how the programming language works. We noticed our first minor problem that the usb cable we were using was just simply charging the arduino board.</p>
    <p>Any program we tried to test would not work , so we ordered a new usb cable that would be specifically for transferring data.</p>

    <h2>Second Blog</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
    The second week of semester two, we decided to create a github.io website to post blogs , any information and progress of our third year project</p>

    <p>The new micro usb cable arrived that we had ordered , allowing us to properly test programs on the arduino board. We started designing a protype and learning the functionallity of the microphone and accelerometer</p>

    <p>We also were learning about the Arduino IDE programming langauge that we had installed on our pcs.We noticed the IDE gave various example code to help learn the fundamentals and test run them on the arduino board</p>

    <h2>Third Blog</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
    The third week of semester two, we started working on the LED Matrix.</p>
    
    <p> We connected the LED Matrix onto the Arduino board using female to male wires and crocodiles clips into the Appropriate pins with the aid of the datasheet provided for the MAX7219 LED Driver. </p>
    
    <p>The VBATT pin from the Arduino is connected to the VCC of the LED which is used to power the LED, The GND is connected to the GND, The DIN is connected to the #6 Pin in the Arduino board which is responsible 
    for the interpreting the code that is inputted, The CS is conntected to the #12 Pin which is responsible for the input delay. The CLK Pin is connected to the #10 Pin.</p>
          
    <p>We completed our prototype , which was one of the most basic programs we could produce. The prototype basically printed "Hello World" on the LED matrix , which can be seen in the video below. </p>
    
    <video width="320" height="240" controls><source src= "prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

    <p>Near the end of week three we created a program to turn on certain led lights on the adafruit playground classic depending on sound volume.</p>

    <p>Achieving this , helped us figure out how to use the microphone on the playground circuit and display the LED lights on the LED matrix depedning on volume.</p>

    <p>By the end of week three , our project was capable of playing animations on a 8x8 matrix with sound.</p>

    <h2>Fourth Blog</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
    The fourth week of semester two, our objective was to play animations on 8x32 matrix.</p>

    <p>Which we completed at the beginning of the week , even though our project was able to display animations with sound. We were unhappy as the mouth animation would not stay open for how long the user was speaking.</p>

    <p>We modified the code by converting the microphones audio input from "baud" to "decibel".As we were more educated on the decibel unit of measurement than baud , this allowed us to make the mouth animation more realistic.Now the mouth animation would stay open depending on how long the user would be speaking for.</p>

    <p>The issues we still face is the accelerometer loop seems to be infinite,user may need to take quite long pauses when speaing into the microphone for a realistic mouth movement and finally working on differnt set of word patterns to mimic a mouth.</p>
