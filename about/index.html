    <p class="paragraph">The following functional specification discusses our third-year project which is based on the 'Clothing-based Wearable Technology' idea. In essence, the product we will be developing is a mask with a responsive LED light strip using a flora arduino board with a microphone that will light up to emulate a mouth speaking or head movement using various animations depending on sound volume , head motion and what words are used as input.</p>
